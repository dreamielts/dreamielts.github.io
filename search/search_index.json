Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part  of what makes us human - indeed, this has played an important part in our success as a species.  Long before the first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there were  plenty of wildebeest over yonder, our ancestors had learnt the value of sending out scouts to  investigate the unknown. </p> <p>This questing nature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread  around the globe, just as it nowadays no doubt helps the last nomadic Penan maintain their  existence in the depleted forests of Borneo, and a visitor negotiate the subways of New York.</p> <p>Over the years, we\u2019ve come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed - different from the rest of  us, different from those of us who are merely \u2018well travelled\u2019, even; and perhaps there is a type of  person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out.  That, however, doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today;  and that in all sorts of professions whether artist, marine biologist or astronomer borders of  the unknown are being tested each day.</p> <p>Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of uncultivated land, and  used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters. He is delving into matters  we all recognise because they are common to humanity. This is surely an act of exploration, and  into a world as remote as the author chooses. Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of  the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones. The  traveller \u2018who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling  laboriously over a country in which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his  other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain people\u2019.</p> <p>In this book about the exploration of the earth\u2019s surface, I have confined myself to those whose  travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery. But that still left me with  another problem: the word \u2018explorer\u2019 has become associated with a past era. We think back to a  golden age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the 19th century - as if the process of discovery  is now on the decline, though the truth is that we have named only one and a half million of this  planet\u2019s species, and there may be more than 10 million - and that\u2019s not including bacteria. We  have studied only 5 per cent of the species we know. We have scarcely mapped the ocean floors,  and know even less about ourselves; we fully understand the workings of only 10 per cent of our  brains.</p>"},{"location":"000.CAM/15/TEST1/L-15-Test1/","title":"L 15 Test1","text":""},{"location":"000.CAM/15/TEST1/L-15-Test1/#15part1-giai-thich","title":"15.part1-gi\u1ea3i th\u00edch","text":"Ng\u00e0y250526 <p>Complete the notes below.</p> <p>Write ONE WORD AND/OR A NUMBER for each answer.</p>"},{"location":"000.CAM/15/TEST1/L-15-Test1/#bankside-recruitment-agency","title":"Bankside Recruitment Agency","text":"<p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Address of agency: 497 Eastside, Docklands</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Name of agent: Becky\u00a01\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Phone number: 07866 510333</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Best to call her in the\u00a02\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p> <p>Typical jobs</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Clerical and admin roles, mainly in the finance industry</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Must have good\u00a03\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 skills</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Jobs are usually for at least one\u00a04\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Pay is usually\u00a05\u00a0\u00a3\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. per hour</p> <p>Registration process</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Wear a\u00a06\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. to the interview</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Must bring your\u00a07\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. to the interview</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0They will ask questions about each applicant\u2019s\u00a08\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p> <p>Advantages of using an agency</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0The\u00a09\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. you receive at interview will benefit you</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Will get access to vacancies which are not advertised</p> <p>\u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0Less\u00a010\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 is involved in applying for jobs </p> <p>AMBER: Hello William.

I know you're hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually \u2013 but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector \u2013 which will look good on your CV \u2013 and generally pays better too.</p> <p>AMBER: Yeah \u2013 I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience.</p> <p>WILLIAM: I wouldn't worry. They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems \u2013 it's communication (Q3) that really matters \u2013 so you'd be fine there. And you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It's not that complicated.</p> <p>AMBER: OK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.</p> <p>WILLIAM: That shouldn't be too difficult. But you're more likely to be offered something for a week (Q4) at first, which might get extended. It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.</p> <p>AMBER: Right, I've heard the pay isn't too bad \u2013 better than working in a shop or a restaurant.</p> <p>WILLIAM: Oh yes \u2013 definitely. The hourly rate is about \u00a310 (Q5), 11 if you're lucky.</p> <p>AMBER: That's pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.</p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p> <p>WILLIAM: Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?</p> <p>AMBER: Yes, please. I know you have to have an interview.</p> <p>WILLIAM: The interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance.</p> <p>AMBER: I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work \u2013 I can probably borrow a suit (Q6) from Mum.</p> <p>WILLIAM: Good idea. It's better to look too smart than too casual.</p> <p>AMBER: Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?</p> <p>WILLIAM: No \u2013 they don't need to see those, I don't think.</p> <p>AMBER: What about my passport? (Q7)</p> <p>WILLIAM: Oh yes \u2013 they will ask to see that.</p> <p>AMBER: OK.</p> <p>WILLIAM: I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though. It's just a chance for them to build a relationship with you \u2013 so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like. So there are questions about personality (Q8) that they always ask candidates \u2013 fairly basic ones. And they probably won't ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.</p> <p>AMBER: Hope not.</p> <p>WILLIAM: Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency \u2013 for example, the interview will be useful because they'll give you feedback (Q9) on your performance so you can improve next time.</p> <p>AMBER: And they'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised.</p> <p>WILLIAM: Exactly \u2013 most temporary jobs aren't advertised.</p> <p>AMBER: And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time (Q10) \u2013 it's much easier than ringing up individual companies.</p> <p>WILLIAM: Yes indeed. Well I think \u2026</p>"},{"location":"000.CAM/15/TEST2/part2/","title":"Part2","text":"<p>Good morning. My name\u2019s Erica Matthews, and I\u2019m the owner of Matthews Island Holidays, a company set up by my parents. Thank you for coming to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer. We\u2019re a small, family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don\u2019t aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our\u00a0many years\u2019 experience \u2013 more than almost any other rail holiday company\u00a0(Q11)\u00a0\u2013 to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations, which we\u2019ve got to know extremely well.</p> <p>I\u2019ll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with Wales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in\u00a0Heysham, where your tour manager will meet you\u00a0(Q12), then you\u2019ll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man. Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead, and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.</p> <p>You have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and\u00a0lunch on the three days when there are organised trips\u00a0(Q13): day four is free, and most people have lunch in a caf\u00e9 or restaurant in Douglas.</p> <p>The price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I\u2019ve mentioned. Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six months in advance or at the last minute, and there\u2019s no supplement for single rooms in hotels.\u00a0If you make a booking then need to change the start date, for example because of illness, you\u2019re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee.\u00a0(Q14)</p> <p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p> <p>OK, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on day one you\u2019ll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The dining room looks out at the\u00a0river\u00a0(Q15), close to where it flows into the harbour, and there\u2019s usually plenty of activity going on.</p> <p>On day two you\u2019ll take the coach to the small town of Peel, on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition. The Isle of Man isn\u2019t part of the United Kingdom, and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald. It\u2019s claimed that this is the world\u2019s oldest parliament that\u2019s still functioning, and that it dates back to 979. However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from\u00a01422\u00a0(Q16), so perhaps it isn\u2019t quite as old as it claims!</p> <p>Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell. This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey. From there it\u2019s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the\u00a0top\u00a0(Q17). Lunch will be in the caf\u00e9, giving you spectacular views of the island.</p> <p>Day four is free for you to explore, using the\u00a0pass\u00a0(Q18)\u00a0which we\u2019ll give you. So you won\u2019t have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island\u2019s heritage sites. Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.</p> <p>The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the\u00a0steam\u00a0(Q19)\u00a0railway, from Douglas to Port Erin. After some time to explore, a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man, a small island just off the coast.

urban engineers learn from dance?","text":"<p>A.\u00a0The way we travel around cities has a major impact on whether they are\u00a0sustainable. Transportation is estimated to account for 30% of\u00a0energy consumption\u00a0in most of the world\u2019s most developed nations, so lowering the need for energy-using vehicles is essential for decreasing the environmental impact of mobility. But as more and more people move to cities, it is important to think about other kinds of sustainable travel too.</p> <p>The ways we travel affect our physical and mental health, our social lives, our access to work and culture, and the air we breathe.</p> <p>Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities through urban design, but the engineering industry still works on the assumptions that led to the creation of the energy-consuming transport systems we have now: the emphasis placed solely on efficiency, speed, and quantitative data. We need radical changes, to make it healthier, more enjoyable, and less environmentally damaging to travel around cities.</p> <p>B.\u00a0Dance might hold some of the answers. That is not to suggest everyone should dance their way to work, however healthy and happy it might make us, but rather that the techniques used by choreographers to experiment with and design movement in dance could provide engineers with tools to stimulate new ideas in city-making. Richard Sennett, an influential urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about the way cities are made, argues that\u00a0urban design\u00a0has suffered from a separation between mind and body since the introduction of the architectural blueprint.</p> <p>C.\u00a0Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, building designs are now conceived and stored in media technologies that\u00a0detach the designer from\u00a0the physical and social realities they are creating. While the design practices created by these new technologies are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city, they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process.</p> <p>D.\u00a0To illustrate, Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, USA, a developed typical of the modernist approach to urban planning prevalent in the 1970s. Peachtree created a grid of streets and towers intended as a new\u00a0pedestrian-friendly downtown for Atlanta.</p> <p>According to Sennett, this failed because its designers had invested too much faith in computer-aided design to tell them how it would operate. They failed to take into account that purpose-built street cafes could not operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older buildings, and would need energy-consuming air conditioning instead, or that its giant car park would feel so unwelcoming that it would put people off getting out of their cars. What seems entirely predictable and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated into reality.</p> <p>E. The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to predict and shape the way people move through the city. Again, these models are necessary, but they are built on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered and other experiences of the city ignored. Designs that seem logical in models appear\u00a0counter-intuitive\u00a0in the actual experience of their users. The guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road, for example, were an engineering solution to pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of traffic. On wide major roads, they often guide pedestrians to specific crossing points and slow down their progress across the road by using staggered access points to divide the crossing into two \u2013 one for each carriageway. In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile, and encouraging others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails. These barriers don\u2019t just make it harder to cross the road: they divide communities and decrease opportunities for healthy transport. As a result, many are now being removed, causing disruption, cost, and waste.</p> <p>F.\u00a0If their designers had had the tools to think with their bodies \u2013 like dancers \u2013 and imagine how these barriers would feel, they might have been a better solution. In order to bring about\u00a0fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities, engineering will need to develop a richer understanding of why people move in certain ways, and how this movement affects them. Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem. Yet it shares with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space. It is an art form developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body, and gaining instant feedback on how the results feel. Choreographers have deep understanding of the psychological, aesthetic, and physical implications of different ways of moving.</p> <p>G.\u00a0Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor, cognitive scientist David Kirsh described how he \u2018thinks with the body\u2019. Kirsh argues that by using the body to simulate outcomes, McGregor is able to imagine solutions that would not be possible using purely abstract thought. This kind of physical knowledge is valued in many areas of expertise, but currently has no place in formal engineering design processes. A suggested method for transport engineers is to improvise design solutions and get instant feedback about how they would work from their own experience of them, or model designs at full scale in the way choreographers experiment with groups of dancers. Above all, perhaps, they might learn to design for emotional as well as functional effects.</p> <p>Reading Passage 2</p>"},{"location":"1.Project/CAM15/Test2/15.R.1/#ky-thuat-o-thi-co-the-hoc-uoc-gi-tu-nhay-mua","title":"K\u1ef9 thu\u1eadt \u0111\u00f4 th\u1ecb c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 h\u1ecdc \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c g\u00ec t\u1eeb nh\u1ea3y m\u00faa?","text":"<p>A.\u00a0Vi\u1ec7c \u0111i l\u1ea1i c\u1ee7a con ng\u01b0\u1eddi c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 \u1ea3nh h\u01b0\u1edfng \u0111\u1ebfn s\u1ef1 b\u1ec1n v\u1eefng c\u1ee7a m\u1ed9t th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1. \u1ede h\u1ea7u h\u1ebft c\u00e1c qu\u1ed1c gia ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n, ng\u01b0\u1eddi ta \u01b0\u1edbc t\u00ednh r\u1eb1ng\u00a0ti\u00eau th\u1ee5 n\u0103ng l\u01b0\u1ee3ng\u00a0ng\u00e0nh giao th\u00f4ng chi\u1ebfm 30%, v\u00ec v\u1eady nhu c\u1ea7u gi\u1ea3m thi\u1ec3u ph\u01b0\u01a1ng ti\u1ec7n ti\u00eau hao n\u0103ng l\u01b0\u1ee3ng l\u00e0 c\u1ea7n thi\u1ebft \u0111\u1ec3 gi\u1ea3m t\u00e1c \u0111\u1ed9ng \u0111\u1ebfn m\u00f4i tr\u01b0\u1eddng do v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111i l\u1ea1i.

Flying in vast numbers across North America, with potentially many millions within a single flock, their migration was once one of nature\u2019s great spectacles. Sadly, the passenger pigeon\u2019s existence\u00a0came to an end\u00a0on 1 September 1914, when the last living specimen died at Cincinati Zoo. Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which now aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as \u2018de-extinction\u2019. The basic premise involves using\u00a0cloning technology\u00a0to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still in existence \u2013 in this case, the abundant band-tailed pigeon \u2013 before being born as a living, breathing animal. Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in this field, but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting-edge technology is being\u00a0trialled.</p> <p>B.\u00a0In Australia, the thylacine, more commonly known sas the Tasmanian tiger, is another extinct creature which genetic scientists striving to bring back to life. \u2018There is no carnivore now in Tasmania that fills the niche which thylacines once occupied,\u2019 explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the decade since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in a \u2018dangerously debilitating\u2019 facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devil_s, the island\u2019s other notorious resident. Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils. \u2018If that contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out whatever region it started. The return of thylacines to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to_ risks of this kind.\u2019</p> <p>C.\u00a0If extinct species can be brought back to life, can humanity begin to correct the damage it has caused to the natural world over the past few millennia? \u2018The idea of de-extinction is that we can reserve this process, bringing species that no longer exist back to life,\u2019 says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz\u2019s Genomics Institute. \u2018I don\u2019t think that we can do this. There is no way to bring back something that is 100 per cent identical to a species that went extinct a long time ago.\u2019 A more practical approach for long-extinct species is to take the DNA of existing species as a template, ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal DNA to create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which looks and/or acts like the animal which died out.</p> <p>D.\u00a0This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question: what is the actual point of this technology? \u2018For us, the goal has always been replacing the extinct species with a suitable replacement,\u2019 explains Novak. \u2018When it comes to breeding, band-tailed pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two nests per hectare, whereas passenger pigeons were very social and would make 10,000 or more nests in one hectare.\u2019 Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This has left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance.\u00a0According to Novak, a hybridised band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that forest\u00a0disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a great many other native species to thrive.</p> <p>E.\u00a0Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth. George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the main way in which the extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ. By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the icy climate of the tundra, the project\u2019s goal is to return mammoth, or a mammoth-like species, to the area. \u2018My highest priority would be preserving the\u00a0endangered\u00a0Asian elephant,\u2019 says Church, \u2018expanding their range to the huge\u00a0ecosystem\u00a0of the tundra. Necessary adaptation would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all traits found in the now extinct woolly mammoth.\u2019 This repopulation of the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions \u2013 elephant punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth. This grass growth would reduce temperatures, and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost.</p> <p>F.\u00a0While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might capture imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an existing species which is merely\u00a0threatened with extinction. \u2018Many of the technologies that people have in mind when they think about de-extinction can be used as a form of \u201cgenetic rescue\u201d,\u2019 explains Shapiro. She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future. \u201cI would also say there\u2019s an incredible moral hazard to not do anything at all,\u2019 she continues. \u2018We know that what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and measured risks.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"1.Project/CAM15/Test2/15.R.2/#chung-ta-co-nen-mang-cac-loai-ong-vat-tuyet-chung-tro-lai","title":"Ch\u00fang ta c\u00f3 n\u00ean mang c\u00e1c lo\u00e0i \u0111\u1ed9ng v\u1eadt tuy\u1ec7t ch\u1ee7ng tr\u1edf l\u1ea1i?","text":"<p>A.\u00a0B\u1ed3 c\u00e2u vi\u1ec5n kh\u00e1ch l\u00e0 lo\u00e0i chim huy\u1ec1n tho\u1ea1i.

Take, for example, the recorded laughter in TV comedy shows. Back in 1950, US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live audiences, so started recording his own \u2018laugh tracks\u2019. These were intended to help people at home feel like they were in a social situation, such as a crowded theatre. Douglass even recorded various types of laughter, as well as mixtures of laughter that is now interesting researchers: a simple \u2018haha\u2019 communicates a\u00a0remarkable\u00a0amount of socially relevant information.</p> <p>In one study conducted in 2016, samples of laughter from pairs of English-speaking students were recorded at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A team made up of more than 30 psychological scientists, anthropologists, and biologists then played these recordings to listeners from 24 diverse societies, from indigenous tribes in New Guinea to city-dwellers\u00a0in India and Europe. Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or strangers. On average, the results were remarkably\u00a0consistent: worldwide, people\u2019s guesses were correct approximately 60% of the time.</p> <p>Researchers have also found that different types of laughter serve as codes to complex human social hierarchies. A team led by Christopher Oveis from the University of California, San Diego, found that high-status had different laughs from low-status and that strangers\u2019 judgements of an individual\u2019s social status were influenced by the\u00a0dominant\u00a0or submissive quality of their laughter. In their study, 48 male college students were randomly assigned to group of four, with each group composed of two low-status members, who had just joined their college fraternity group, and two high-status members, older students who had been active in the fraternity for at least two years. Laughter was recorded as each student took a turn at being teased by the others, involving the use of mildly insulting nicknames. Analysis revealed that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more dominant laughs and fewer\u00a0submissive\u00a0laughs relative to the low-status individuals. Meanwhile, low-status individuals were more likely to change their laughter based on their position of power; that is, the newcomers produced more dominant laughs when they were in the \u2018powerful\u2019 role of teasers. Dominant laughter was higher in pitch, louder, and more variable in tone than submissive laughter.</p> <p>A random group of volunteers then listened to an equal number of dominant and submissive laughs from both the high- and low-status individuals, and were asked to estimate the social status of the laughter. In line with predictions, laughers producing submissive laughs. \u2018This was particularly true for low-status individuals, who were rated as significantly higher in status when displaying a dominant versus submissive laugh,\u2019 Oveis and colleagues note. \u2018Thus, by strategically displaying more dominant laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve higher status in the eyes of others.\u2019 However, high-status individuals were rated as high-status whether they produced their natural laugh or tried to do a submissive one.</p> <p>Another study, conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of Australian National University, was based on the hypothesis that humour might provide a respite from\u00a0tedious\u00a0situations in the workplace. This \u2018mental break\u2019 might facilitate the replenishment of mental resources. To test this theory, the researchers recruited 74 business students, ostensibly for an experiment on perception. First, the students performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance of the letter \u2018e\u2019 over two pages of text. The students then were randomly assigned to watch a video clip eliciting either humour, contentment, or neutral feelings. Some watched a clip of the BBC comedy\u00a0Mr. Bean, others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a factual video about the management profession.</p> <p>The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles, and were told that making 10 correct assessments in a row would lead to a win. However, the software was programmed such that it was nearly impossible to achieve 10 consecutive correct answers. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point. Students who had watched the\u00a0Mr. Bean\u00a0video ended up spending significantly more time working on the task, making twice as many predictions as the other two groups.</p> <p>Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study, during which they had participants complete long multiplication questions by hand. Again, participants who watched the humorous video spent significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed more questions correctly than did the students in either of the other groups.</p> <p>\u2018Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate social relationships, the traditional view of task performance implies that individuals should avoid things such as humour that may distract them from the accomplishment of task goals,\u2019 Cheng and Wang conclude. \u2018We suggest that humour is not only enjoyable but more importantly, energizing.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"1.Project/CAM15/Test2/15.R.3/#tieng-cuoi","title":"Ti\u1ebfng c\u01b0\u1eddi","text":"<p>K\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 c\u1ee7a c\u00e1c nh\u00e0 khoa h\u1ecdc t\u00e2m l\u00fd ti\u1ebft l\u1ed9 t\u1ea7m quan tr\u1ecdng c\u1ee7a s\u1ef1 h\u00e0i h\u01b0\u1edbc</p> <p>Lo\u00e0i ng\u01b0\u1eddi b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n khi\u1ebfu h\u00e0i h\u01b0\u1edbc s\u1edbm v\u00e0o l\u00fac 6 tu\u1ea7n tu\u1ed5i, khi \u0111\u1ee9a b\u00e9 b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u c\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u1ec3 ph\u1ea3n \u1ee9ng l\u1ea1i k\u00edch th\u00edch.

appropriate  for you.  </p> <p>So,  what  can  you  do  to  solve  this  problem? </p> <p>Well  there  are  several  things  to  keep  in  mind.  </p> <p>Firstly  you  need  to do  your  research  so  that  you  are  very  familiar  with  all  the  current  literature. </p> <p>Tr\u01b0\u1edbc ti\u00ean, b\u1ea1n c\u1ea7n th\u1ef1c hi\u1ec7n nghi\u00ean c\u1ee9u c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh \u0111\u1ec3

knowledge  of  your  area  of  specialisation. </p> <p>If  you  do  this,  it  will help  you  with  the  next  important  point  in  choosing  a  good  subject  for your  research,  which  is  to  ascertain  what  is  relevant  in  your  research  area.  </p> <p>This  will  be  crucial  in  helping  you  to  narrow  your  choices  down. </p> <p>From  the  very  beginning,  it  really  is  vital  to  set  clear  limits  and  to  have a  very  fixed  plan  in  terms  of  the  scope  of  your  research. </p> <p>T\u1eeb ngay t\u1eeb \u0111\u1ea7u, th\u1eadt s\u1ef1 r\u1ea5t quan tr\u1ecdng

very  important  factor  to take  into  accountis your  own  financial  resources. </p> <p>If  these  are  limited  then  you  need  to avoid  choosing  a  study  that  will  involve  costly  equipment  or  surveys. </p> <p>However,  if  this  is  the  case,  you  needn\u2019t  despair  or  abandon  your  ideas altogether,  instead  make  enquiries  into  funding  from  external  agencies

Another change was so subtle as to pass more or less unnoticed. Like many players, Murray has long preferred a racket that consists of two types of string: one for the mains (verticals) and another for the crosses (horizontals). While he continued to use natural string in the crosses, in 2012 he switched to synthetic string for the mains. Small change, perhaps, but its importance should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Trong s\u1ed1 nh\u1eefng thay \u0111\u1ed5i gi\u1ea3i th\u00edch cho s\u1ef1\u00a0chuy\u1ec3n m\u00ecnh\u00a0(transformation) n\u00e0y, c\u00f3 m\u1ed9t thay \u0111\u1ed5i r\u00f5 r\u00e0ng v\u00e0 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c c\u00f4ng b\u1ed1 r\u1ed9ng r\u00e3i: v\u00e0o n\u0103m 2011, Murray \u0111\u00e3 m\u1eddi c\u1ef1u tay v\u1ee3t s\u1ed1 m\u1ed9t Ivan Lendl v\u00e0o \u0111\u1ed9i hu\u1ea5n luy\u1ec7n c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh \u2013 m\u1ed9t b\u1ed5 sung qu\u00fd gi\u00e1 c\u00f3 t\u00e1c \u0111\u1ed9ng r\u00f5 r\u1ec7t \u0111\u1ebfn phong c\u00e1ch thi \u0111\u1ea5u c\u1ee7a anh.
