AMBER: Hello William. This is Amber – you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned. Is now a good time?

WILLIAM: Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside – they're based in Docklands – I can tell you the address now – 497 Eastside.

AMBER: OK, thanks. So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there?

WILLIAM: The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson.

AMBER: Let me write that down – Becky …

WILLIAM: **Jamieson (Q1)** J-A-M-I-E-S-O-N.

AMBER: Do you have her direct line?

WILLIAM: Yes, it's in my contacts somewhere – right, here we are: 078 double 6, 510 triple 3. I wouldn't call her until the **afternoon (Q2)** if I were you – she's always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She's really helpful and friendly so I'm sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.

AMBER: It's mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn't it?

WILLIAM: That's right. I know you're hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually – but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector – which will look good on your CV – and generally pays better too.

AMBER: Yeah – I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience.

WILLIAM: I wouldn't worry. They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it's **communication (Q3)** that really matters – so you'd be fine there. And you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It's not that complicated.

AMBER: OK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.

WILLIAM: That shouldn't be too difficult. But you're more likely to be offered something for a **week (Q4)** at first, which might get extended. It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.

AMBER: Right, I've heard the pay isn't too bad – better than working in a shop or a restaurant.

WILLIAM: Oh yes – definitely. The hourly rate is about £**10 (Q5)**, 11 if you're lucky.

AMBER: That's pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.

————————————————

WILLIAM: Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?

AMBER: Yes, please. I know you have to have an interview.

WILLIAM: The interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance.

AMBER: I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work – I can probably borrow a **suit (Q6)** from Mum.

WILLIAM: Good idea. It's better to look too smart than too casual.

AMBER: Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?

WILLIAM: No – they don't need to see those, I don't think.

AMBER: What about my **passport**? **(Q7)**

WILLIAM: Oh yes – they will ask to see that.

AMBER: OK.

WILLIAM: I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though. It's just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like. So there are questions about **personality (Q8)** that they always ask candidates – fairly basic ones. And they probably won't ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.

AMBER: Hope not.

WILLIAM: Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency – for example, the interview will be useful because they'll give you **feedback** **(Q9)** on your performance so you can improve next time.

AMBER: And they'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised.

WILLIAM: Exactly – most temporary jobs aren't advertised.

AMBER: And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less **time (Q10)** – it's much easier than ringing up individual companies.

WILLIAM: Yes indeed. Well I think …
