The aftermath of the 2024 US presidential election has been a boon to Elon Musk.

The richest person in the world got even richer Friday, with Musk’s net worth hitting a record $347.8 billion, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-22/elon-musk-s-net-worth-hits-348-billion-setting-new-wealth-record). That beats his previous record set in November 2021, when the Tesla founder’s net worth exceeded $340 billion, according to the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/).

Shares of Tesla have rallied since the November 5 election and climbed 3.8% on Friday. [Since Election Day](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/business/elon-musk-trump-government-companies-hnk-intl/index.html), the stock has risen about 40% on investors’ belief that [Musk’s influence in the Trump administration ](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/politics/musk-trump-influence-transition/index.html)will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company. Musk, Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, is roughly $83 billion richer since Election Day, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

An [alliance with President-elect Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/business/elon-musk-doge-department-of-government-efficiency/index.html) has pushed Musk and his ventures to the forefront. Musk is the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, as well as the owner of X and CEO of other ventures, including Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Company. Now, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, he will oversee a new “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE),” named after a memecoin.

Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value this week in a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, [according to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musks-startup-xai-valued-at-50-billion-in-new-funding-round-7e3669dc).

Musk has skyrocketed past his peers on the billionaire rankings, which often sees the top contenders swapping places. As of Tuesday, Musk was more than $100 billion richer than the second richest person, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
