Sam 
Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Sam. 

 

Neil 
And I’m Neil. 

 

Sam  
Come on, Neil, let’s make a start! I’ve got a deadline to meet today, and I haven’t 
finished my work yet! 

 

Neil 
Let me guess, it’s because you delayed, and delayed, and put your work off until 
the last minute - as usual! You’re a real procrastinator, Sam – someone who keeps 
delaying things that need to be done. 

 

Sam  
What can I say? I work better when a deadline is approaching. 

 

Neil 
I see, but did you know that that people who procrastinate have higher levels of 
stress and lower wellbeing? Procrastination is also linked with lower financial and 
career success, so there's a lot of reasons not to do it. 

 

Sam  
In this programme, we’re discussing procrastination – the act of delaying things 
that must be done until later, often because they’re difficult, boring or unpleasant. 
And, as usual, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary along the way. 

 

Neil 
So, without wasting any more time, I have a question for you, Sam. The fact that 
procrastinating, or putting things off, is bad for us doesn’t stop people doing it. 

According to recent research by DePaul University in Chicago, what percentage of 
people procrastinate so much that it interferes with their day-to-day life? Is it: 

 

a) 10 percent? 
b) 20 percent? or, 
c) 30 percent? 

 

Sam  
I’ll guess that around 10 percent of people have a serious procrastination problem. 

 

Neil 
OK, Sam. We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Sam is certainly not 
alone in putting things off until the last minute. Here’s Ella al-Shamahi, presenter 
of BBC Radio 4’s, Why Do We Do That? talking to the comedian, Eshaan Akbar, 
about his procrastination habit: 

 

Ella al-Shamahi  
Would you say, Eshaan, that you're a procrastinator?  

 

Eshaan Akbar 
I am a serial procrastinator without a shadow of a doubt.  

 

Ella al-Shamahi 
Why? Why do you think you procrastinate?  

 

Eshaan Akbar 
Over the years, I've told myself that I procrastinate because I work better under 
pressure. That's what I've told myself.  

 

Sam  
Eshaan thinks that he is a procrastinator without a shadow of a doubt, a phrase 
which is used to emphasise that you are completely certain of something. 

 

Neil 
Eshaan also says that, like Sam, he works better under pressure, when he feels 
stressed or anxious because of having too much to do. But maybe, also like Sam, 
Eshaan has a problem organising his workload and managing his time. 

 

Sam  
Hang on, Neil, my time management skills are OK, thank you! With me, it’s more 
of an emotional response – I see a mountain of work, feel threatened, and think, 
‘how on earth will I finish all that?!’ 

What Sam says is supported by a theory of human evolution which explains how 
putting things off is an emotional response. Back when we were living in caves, life 
was dangerous and short, and our ancestors were impulsive – they acted suddenly, 
on instinct, without thinking about the consequences of what they were doing. 
Back then, being impulsive was a good thing, but in modern life, with work goals 
and deadlines, when we are impulsive and get distracted, we procrastinate. So 
rather than being a problem with time management, Sam should blame her 
caveman ancestors who acted on impulse. 

 

Sam  
Hmm, an interesting idea, but it’s not going to help me meet my deadline! Let’s 
listen again to comedian Eshaan Akbar talking how he feels when he 
procrastinates: 

 

Eshaan Akbar 
A lot of stuff you read about procrastination focuses on the time management 
element of it… I probably got a better sense that for me it seems very squarely 
around the emotional aspect of it. Perhaps I get more emotional gratification from 
doing it last minute. And, I need to understand why I prefer that over the calm 
serenity of getting things done with oodles of time on my hands. 

 

Neil 
In the same way that our ancestors felt good living on impulse, Eshaan thinks he 
gets gratification - a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction – from doing things at 
the last minute. What he doesn’t understand is why he prefers to work under 
pressure, instead of finishing calmly with oodles, or lots of, time. 

 

Sam  
Unlike Eshaan, I’d rather finish my work feeling relaxed, but there never seems to 
be enough time. 

 

Neil 
Well, breaking down the task into smaller stages also breaks down the level of 
threat you feel from your workload. Also, forgiving yourself for procrastinating in 
the past seems helpful in avoiding procrastinating in the future. So, forgive 
yourself and start making changes, Sam, before you end up like the timewasters 
in my question: what percentage of people procrastinate so much that it interferes 
with day-to-day life. 

 

Sam  
Well, I guessed it was 10 percent. 

Neil 
Which was… the wrong answer, I’m afraid. In fact around 20 percent of us have a 
procrastination habit so strong it makes life difficult. Okay, let’s recap the 
vocabulary we’ve learned from this programme on procrastination – delaying, or 
putting off,  doing things until later, often because they’re difficult, unpleasant or 
boring. 

 

Sam  
The phrase without a shadow of a doubt is used to emphasise that you are 
completely certain of something. 

 

Neil 
If you’re under pressure, you feel stressed or anxious because of having too 
much to do. 

 

Sam  
Impulsive behaviour is sudden and spontaneous, done without thinking about the 
consequences. 

 

Neil 
Gratification means a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction. 

 

Sam  
And finally, when you have oodles of something, you have a lot of a very large 
amount of something pleasant…. like time, which once again we’ve run out of. I’m 
rushing off to finish my work, Neil, but remember to make time to join us again 
soon, here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now! 

 

Neil 
Bye!
