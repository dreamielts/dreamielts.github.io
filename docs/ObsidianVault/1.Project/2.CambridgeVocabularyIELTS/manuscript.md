> The heart is considered to be a muscle and, just like any other muscle in your body, your diet has ==a direct impact== on the way that it works. The food you eat every day can affect the way that blood flows through your heart and arteries. A diet that is high in fat can gradually cause a build-up in your arteries that slows down the ==blood flow== and can even block small arteries. If an artery that carries blood to the heart becomes blocked, the heart muscle can die. This is known as a heart attack and sufferers must receive treatment quickly. If the blockage occurs in an artery that carries blood to the brain, part of the brain can die. This is known as a stroke. The effects of a stroke can be ==debilitating== and there is no known cure. The correct diet can help you control your weight and keep your arteries clear, thereby reducing the risk of heart problems and stroke.

> So, what can you do to lose weight? 
> Well, exercise is by far the best way. : <font color="#c0504d">Chà, tập thể dục là cách tốt nhất vô cùng.</font>
>  Burning calories and ==working off== the fat will help you look and feel better. 
>  Regular exercise helps you burn calories faster, even when you are sitting still. 
>  But what is the best type of exercise for your heart?
>   Well, studies have shown that ==aerobic exercise== causes you to breathe more deeply and makes your heart work harder to pump blood. 
>   Aerobic exercise also raises your heart rate and thus burns calories. 
>   Common examples of aerobic exercise include walking ==briskly==, jogging, running, swimming and cycling. 
>   People are often unsure just how much exercise they need. 
>   Again, recent studies can help. 
>   These have shown that it's best to begin slowly and gradually work up to 30 minutes of exercise, four to six times a week. 
>   However, your doctor may make a different recommendation based on your health. 
>   For example, it may be best to start with only a couple of minutes of exercise or begin at a fairly slow pace. 
>   If you are not used to exercise, be sure to pay careful attention to your body. 
>   ==One sure sign that== you may be overdoing it is if you can’t carry on a conversation while you exercise.
>    ==Một dấu hiệu chắc chắn rằng== bạn có thể quá sức là nếu bạn không thể duy trì một cuộc trò chuyện trong khi tập thể dục.
>   To give your body the chance to recover, it’s also best to alternate exercise days with  rest days.
