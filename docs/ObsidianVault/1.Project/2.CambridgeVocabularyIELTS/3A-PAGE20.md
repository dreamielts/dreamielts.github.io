> The heart is considered to be a muscle and, just like any other muscle in your body, your diet has ==[[a direct impact]]== on the way that it works. The food you eat every day can affect the way that blood flows through your heart and [[arteries]]. A diet that is high in fat can gradually cause a[[ build-up]] in your arteries that slows down the ==blood flow== and can even block small arteries. If an artery that carries blood to the heart becomes blocked, the heart muscle can die. This is known as a [[heart attack]] and sufferers must receive [[treatment]] quickly. If the [[blockage]] occurs in an artery that carries blood to the brain, part of the brain can die. This is known as a [[stroke]]. [[The effects of a stroke]] can be ==[[debilitating]]== and [[there is no known cure]]. The correct diet can help you control your weight and keep your [[arteries]] clear, thereby reducing [[the risk of heart problems and stroke.]]
