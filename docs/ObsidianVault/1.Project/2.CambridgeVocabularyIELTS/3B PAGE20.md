> So, what can you do to lose weight? 
> Well, exercise is [[by far the best way]]. : <font color="#c0504d">Chà, tập thể dục là cách tốt nhất vô cùng.</font>
>  Burning calories and ==working off== the fat will help you look and feel better. 
>  Regular exercise helps you burn calories faster, even when you are sitting still. 
>  But what is the best type of exercise for your heart?
>   Well, studies have shown that ==aerobic exercise== causes you to breathe more deeply and makes your heart work harder to pump blood. 
>   Aerobic exercise also[[ raises your heart rate]] and thus burns calories. 
>   Common examples of aerobic exercise include walking ==[[briskly]]==, jogging, running, swimming and cycling. 
>   People are often [[unsure]] just how much exercise they need. 
>   Again, recent studies can help. 
>   These have shown that it's best to begin slowly and gradually work up to 30 minutes of exercise, four to six times a week. 
>   However, your doctor may make a different [[recommendation]] based on your health. 
>   For example, it may be best to start with only a couple of minutes of exercise or begin at a fairly slow pace. 
>   If you are not used to exercise, be sure to pay careful attention to your body. 
>   ==[[One sure sign that]]== you may be [[overdoing]] it is if you can’t carry on a conversation while you exercise.
>    ==[[Một dấu hiệu chắc chắn rằng]]== bạn có thể [[quá sức]] là nếu bạn không thể duy trì một cuộc trò chuyện trong khi tập thể dục.
>   To give your body the chance to recover, it’s also best to [[alternate]] [[exercise days]] with [[ rest days]].
