Teacher: Can you tell me about your early education?

Student: Well, I went to kindergarten from the age of four and I rermember that T didn't enjoy it very much at all. Primary school was a little better, especially because my mum was a teacher in the schoal. She taught in the junior part of the school and she was actually my teacher in first grade but when [ went up to the senior school T didn’t see very much of her. After that | was lucky enough to receive a scholarship to go to a very good high school. 

My parents couldn’t have afforded to send me to a private school so it was a really great opportunity for me. 

It was a single-sex school so there were no boys. 

I'm glad I didn’t go to a mixed school because 1 think there are [[fewer]] [[distractions]] so everyore can just concentrate on their studies.
