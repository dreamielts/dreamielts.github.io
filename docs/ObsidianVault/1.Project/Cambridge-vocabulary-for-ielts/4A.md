**Recording  4a** 
Interviewer:  [[Do  you  think  people  work  too  much  nowadays]] ?
Speaker  1:    Not  really,  I    think  people  have  always  worked  hard  for  a 
living. 
<font color="#ff0000">Tôi không nghĩ vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng mọi người luôn luôn làm việc chăm chỉ để kiếm sống.</font>

I mean  it's  never  been  easy  for  anyone,  has  it? 

You  have  to work  hard  if  you  want  to  achieve  anything  in  your  life  
  [[that's  just the  way  it   is ]]  and  there  isn’'t  a   lot  you  can  do  about  it.  
  
<font color="#7030a0">Đó chỉ là cách nó xảy ra và không có nhiều thứ bạn có thể làm về nó.</font>

  
   ==[[Life  has  its ups  and  downs]]==  and  I think  the  best  thing  to  do  is  accept  that  and 
get  on  with  it 

<font color="#7030a0">Đời sống có những lúc thăng trầm và tôi nghĩ điều tốt nhất là chấp nhận điều đó và tiếp tục sống.</font>


## Interviewer:  What  do  you  like  to  do  to  relax? 

Speaker  2:    For  me  there  is   only  one  way  to  relax  and  that's  through 
sport.  |    like  ta  live  life  on  the  edge,  so  [     do  a   lot  of  extreme  sports 
like  paragliding  and  deep  sea  diving.  When  you're  in  a   dangerous 
situation,  that's  when  you  really  feel  alive.  I   think  your  attitude  has 
a    big  impact  on  your  quality  of  life. 
Interviewer:  What’s  your  idea  of  a   perfect  day? 
Speaker  3:   1don’t  think  there's  any  such  thing  as  the  perfect  day 
-  something  always  seems  to  happen  to  spoil  it.  Some  people 
say 
|   have  a   negative  attitude,  but  if [  plan  a   picnic  with  friends 
then  either  it   rains  or  my  friends  decide  not  to  come  along.  | 
think  it's  a   waste  of  time  making  plans  like  that.  Life  can  be  full  of 
disappointments. 
Interviewer:  How  would  you  describe  your  attitude  to  life? 
Speaker  4:   |     have  a   very  positive  outlook  on  life.  [    think  it's 
impartant  ta  treat  every  day  as  special  and  live  life  to  the  full.  Some 
people  approach  everything  as  if  their  glass  is   half  empty.  If   you 
do  that  then  it   will  colour  every  experience  you  have.  I     think  if  you 
want  to  lead  a   happy  life  then  you  need  to  have  a   positive  approach 
to  everything.
